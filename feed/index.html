<p>. Numerous things encountered when using citation or creating a draft may lead to rejection of the write-up professionalism.

		<title>Application 4: Correlations  This week, you explore key statistical concepts related to data and problem solving through the completion of the following exercises using SPSS and the information found in your Statistics and Data Analysis for Nursing Research textbook. The focus of this assignment will be on correlation coefficients, tools that can help to determine the strength of the relationship between variables. Because multiple factors influence health care variables, it is important for you to understand how to calculate and interpret correlation coefficients.  To prepare: Review the Statistics and Data Analysis for Nursing Research chapters that you read as a part of the Week 6 Learning Resources. As you do so, pay close attention to the examples presented—they provide information that will be useful for you to recall when completing the software exercises. You may also wish to review the Research Methods for Evidence-Based Practice video resources. Refer to the Week 6 Correlations Exercises and follow the directions to calculate correlational statistics using Polit2SetB.sav data set. Compare your data output against the tables presented in the Week 6 Correlations Exercises SPSS Output document. Formulate an initial interpretation of the meaning or implication of your calculations.</title>

<p>Among the current problems of the modern generation are eating disorders. They are problematic in that they affect the lifestyles of people whereby they make their lives uncomfortable.

<p><b>Predictors of Depression in Men</b></p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In the past, depression was considered a condition for women but in the recent years, more men are being diagnosed with the condition each year. In the United States, more than 6 million people are diagnosed with depression each year. However, this number may be inaccurate due to the fact that most people especially men, do not go to the hospital due to fear of stigma and discrimination from the general population. This is because; depressive conditions are associated with weakness. Most studies look at depression in women and very few look at depression in men. </p>

<p>Acid Rain in the Northeast USA: Effect on Water and or Fisheries.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>U.S. Senator Daniel P. Moynihan raised the issue of acid rain before the Congress in October 1998. The longtime advocate of the issue, stated that ‘the Adirondacks’ fishermen began to protest about the concern of the ‘the big one that got away.’ The fish that were once abundant in the remote Adirondack lakes were not only hard to catch, they were gone. The issue of acid rain hit the attention in USA in the mid-1970s. During this time, little was known about the distribution and magnitude of acid rain </p>

Offer and support an opinion. Validate an idea with your own experience. Make a suggestion. Expand on your colleague’s posting.  Ang Pobanz  RE: Discussion 2 &#8211; Week 6 &#8211; Initial Question COLLAPSE Necessary Conditions for Obedience              Fiske (2014) defines obedience as “the influence of authority demands on subordinates” (p. 530). In order for obedience to occur, certain conditions are necessary. Milgram found that research participants would deliver increasingly painful shocks to another participant if they were prompted to do so in the name of science. The Milgram experiment revealed that having an authority figure in the same room increased the likelihood of the participant delivering higher voltage shocks (BBC, n.d.). However, if the participant being shocked sat in the same room as the participant delivering the shock, obedience decreased. As an aside, this may help explain why online abuse and bullying can appear so dramatically different from face-to-face bullying. Being hidden and/or anonymous makes being the “bad guy” easier. Additionally, obedience was proportional to the immediacy of the victim; the more immediate the victim, the greater the decrease in obedience of the participant. Also, if a peer rebels, observers are more likely to refuse to obey as well particularly if the task makes them uncomfortable (Fiske, 2014).                Other things to factor in when considering conditions for obedience include individual differences, personality variables, type of society (collectivist vs. individualistic), time frame (more conservative periods in history vs. more experimental or questioning), and core motives for allocating control – in this case to an authority figure, belonging (by being cooperative and “good”), and understanding (relying on an authority figure to know what is best) (Fiske, 2014).  Obedience as Necessary              When I think of necessary obedience I think of a military unit engaged in combat.  The rules of a platoon are made very clear to every member and there is a clear expectation that each soldier follows orders, obey the chain of command, and behave in ways consistent with their extensive training.  A high degree of obedience in this case is what helps keep military personnel alive and helps to achieve given combat objectives. When soldiers do not obey, it can cost lives.  Obedience as Harmful              Obedience can be harmful in a number of ways. One historical example is found in the Nazi regime, which was one of the seminal motivations for Milgram’s experiments. As a person who identified as Jewish, he wanted to better understand how seemingly ordinary people could carry out such atrocities as those experienced by the Jewish people and Jewish sympathizers during the Holocaust (Benjamin &#038; Simpson, 2009; Fiske, 2014). The same authority that worked for Milgram’s actors in his experiments were at work in the Nazi regime. Because of what some might term “blind” obedience to authority, an entire army of loyalists to the Nazi regime carried out orders of genocide. Additionally, widespread acceptance of Hitler’s propaganda and persuasion, and the observance of others following orders helped the rationalization and justification of discrimination and extermination unfold. Ultimately, over six million Jewish men, women, and children were murdered as a result of people “just following orders”.    References  BBC. (n.d.).

<p>In most cases, people are often dedicated to obeying those in authority. Obedience, which is described as respecting and undertaking orders from leaders, has been studied to understand the way people undertake their orders. Researchers have often focused on the way people undertake orders that are violent in nature. Milgram, a researcher who conducted an experiment on obedience, came up with conclusions that have helped uncover some of the trends of cyber-bullying (Rochat &amp; Blass, 2014). In yet another experiment, Zimbardo conducted a study in which he aimed at understanding the way prisoners and prison warders receive </p>

<p>More than half a million people sleep outside, or in an emergency shelter in the United States. Several other people also spend their time in the several transitional housing programs in the almost all the American states. While the national statistics paint a fair picture as regards to homelessness, the state of homelessness in some American states has been worrying all along. The current paper analyzes the state of homelessness in the state of Utah, which for many years had chronic homelessness. The State of Utah has reduced its homelessness levels by up to </p>
