And we all know how precious time can be when you have to finish your paper by a due date. So, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a citation maker to make them faster? It certainly would!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How It Works<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our free citation creator can automatically generate proper citations for works cited in your paper. The whole process is simple:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>You choose the citation style that should be applied to your paper:\u00a0APA,\u00a0MLA,\u00a0Chicago,\u00a0Turabian\u00a0or Harvard. If you are not sure which one to choose, you should check your paper instructions or consult your instructor.<\/li><li>You choose a source type from the list. Citations taken from a book, a newspaper article, or an online source have different formats. Make sure you\u2019ve chosen the right one.<\/li><li>Enter the author\u2019s or editor\u2019s name, the title of the source, and the year it was published. Also, add the location and the publisher, page numbers, the website address, or any other information, depending on the type of source you choose.<\/li><li>Press \u201cGenerate\u201d and a proper citation will appear that is ready to use.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, this can save your time greatly. There is no need to search for formatting guides on each of the styles and look them up every time you have to cite a source. It\u2019s monotonous work and takes more time than people want to complete it. So, it is a great idea to let our program do the work for you online. You just enter all the necessary information, press the button, and that\u2019s it: your citation is ready!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A perfectly written paper should be without errors in grammar, structure, order of thoughts, formatting, etc. While paying enough attention to the content of your work, you shouldn\u2019t underestimate its form.
